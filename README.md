# FizzBuzz Challenge

A placeholder for entries in the FizzBuzz Challenge

## Background

In September 2021, some members of the St. Louis Unix User's Group: [St. Louis Unix User's Group](https://www.sluug.org)
participated in a programming challenge: FizzBuzz. Members submitted their
answers on the group's discussion mailing list

[SLUUG Discuss ML: https://www.sluug.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss](https://www.sluug.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss)


This repository is a hub for investigating the various approaches to the challenge.
Members and anyone else who wish can submit their answers and they can be discussed
herein. Just fork this repository and edit this file, push it and issue
an pull request [PR].


## The challenge

Create a computer program that prints all numbers in the range from 1 to 100, one per line.
Except, if the number is divisible by 3, then print Fizz instead.
Also, if the number is divisible by 5, then print Buzz instead.
Finally, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 ,  print FizzBuzz instead.
Else, just print the number.

### Sample output:

```bash
./fizzbuzz.rb
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13

fizzbuzz
```
