# The fasted FizzBuzz implementations

## Abstract

Some more implementations of FizzBuzz. These come from a posting on 
codegolf.stackexchange.com where the poster asked for submissions  of the fastest
possible throughput output of the normal fizzbuzz program.

Collected here are some of those submissions and 1 or 2 of my own own attempts.
